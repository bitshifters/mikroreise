WIP Features
~~~
- Overscan screen?
  - Not currently - 320x256
- Menu at top.
  - Similar to before.
  - Looks like the same font.
- Spinning cube centre LHS of screen.
  - Faces shades of blue.
  - Rendered on top of everything.
- Scrolltext at bottom, 16x16 or 20x20 maybe?
  - Single colour font?
  - Masked on top of background
  - Single pixel scroll?
- Vertically scrolling toothed columns (what to call these?)
  - Five columns
  - 'Teeth' are 16x16
  - Columns are 3x 'teeth' wide
  - Columns overlap by 1x 'teeth' width
  - Columns scroll upwards are different speeds
  - Shades of grey-blue from dark (centre) to light (rhs screen)

Cube visualiser code from Bodo:

    lea mt_Visualizer,a0                                                ; a0 = &mt_Visualizer
    lea scale,a1    ; cube-scale , INC_X, INC_Y, INC_Z                  ; a1 = &cube_deltas
    moveq #4-1,d7   ; number of voices                                  ; d7 = 3
.l:     moveq #15,d0        ;maxvalue 15                                ; d0 = 15
        sub.w (a0)+,d0      ;-#frames/irqs since instrument trigger     ; d0 = 15 - mt_Visualizer[i] (irqs since instrument trigger)
        bpl.s .ok           ;below minvalue?                            ; if > 0 goto .ok
        moveq #0,d0         ;then set to minvalue                       ; d0 = 0
    .ok:
        lsl #1,d0                                                       ; d0 *= 2
        move.w d0,(a1)+     ;poke value                                 ; cube_deltas[i] = d0
        dbf d7,.l                                                       ; if --d7 != 0 goto .1

    move.w scale,d0                                                     ; d0 = cube_deltas[0] (scale)
    mulu #10,d0                                                         ; d0 *= 10
    add.w #START_SIZE,d0 ; add START_SIZE of scale                      ; d0 += START_SIZE
    move.w d0,scale                                                     ; cube_deltas[0] = d0

    => 40 words across width of screen.
    => For each word column we read 1x glyph word but write 2x.
    => Read/mask/write 1x into previous column (shifted)
    => Read/mask/write 1x into current column (shifted)
    => 16x for font height.
    => Total read/mask/write = 41*16*lots
  - Could have scroller glyphs on a modest sine wave if we wanted? - DONE

- Music playback.
  - Ping ToBach & 4mat - DONE
  - Master volume of each tune? - DONE
  - Pause between tunes during autoplay? - DONE
- Archie specific:
  - Remove _DJANGO define. - DONE
  - Performance on ARM2? - DONE (CAN ALWAYS DO MORE!)
    1. Scrolltext - cyan
      => Plot glyphs in one go and deal with edges separately. - DONE
    2. Menu - blue
    3. Cube - red
      => Could combine edge determination & rasterisation. - DONE
    4. Logo - magenta
    5. Columns - yellow
    6. Screen clear - green
    => Keyboard scan is also surprisingly high...
      - Rich says use key pressed event and store a mask... DONE!
    => Improve update_3D_scene as well. => DONE
  - Do we need RasterMan or get RasterMan Lite for stablised interrupts. => NO.
  - Remove redundant code. - DONE I THINK?
  - Shrink exe - DONE
  - Add new !ReadMe etc. ASCII from ne7. - DONE
  - Ask Bodo for an app icon? - DONE
  - Write some scrolltext! - DONE

Scrolltext
~~~
If pre-shifted glyph?
- Load 3x words of glyph.
- Read/mask/store to screen (potentially everything shifted by +1 word for >8 pixels)
- Invert the shift so +7 is offset to the right rather than left.
- Plot entire glyph, don't worry about screen edge just yet.
- Plot slices of glyph on LHS & RHS as required.

Proportional menu font
~~~
Spaces are 5 pixels (!) 'i' is 4 pixels.
=> Plot menu strings into 'sprite' at init.
- Calculate pixel width of string => word width of sprite.
- Optionally align string to RHS of sprite.
- Plot glyphs at pixel offset.

Archie custom features...?
- Small Y offset for scroller? - DONE
- Reinstate logo glitch when loading tune? Or a wibble?
  => Can have the logo following a different path.
- Add cube lighting back?
- Make cube blip right & left for a few frames to simulate 'load glitch'.
- Make the scrolltext appear nicely from behind the last column?
  => Probably a pain to do and more cycles.
- Swap sample speed depending on CPU speed... - DONE
- Set VU bars effect on 1/2/3 keys. - DONE

Bug fixes from Steve:
- Check monitortype and adjust T1 timing? - NOT SURE!
- Load tracks using R0=-1 (RMA copy) for QTM_Load. - DONE
- Use SWI QTM_SongStatus and check bit 4 of R0 for end of track. - REPLACED BY TIMER
  (This is easier than the music interrupt method previously.)
- When autoplay is on, you might want to try clearing bit 2 of the music options byte, - REPLACED BY TIMER
  using SWI QTM_MusicOptions, this will ensure each track fully stops at the end,
  and doesn't loop round and start playing a few micro seconds of the start before the next track loads.

Woah! We consistently drop a frame every 0x130 = 304 frames! WTF?
This still happens even if QTM is turned off..
This still happens when all plotting is turned off..
Not sure vsync counting or frame swapping is correct somehow?
=> Turned out to be Timer 0 colliding with VSync and RO IRQ handler
   giving T0 higher priority than vsync, causing our handler to be
   re-entered. Fixed with a bodge flag to detect this.

For multi-buffer:
- Screen we're currently showing.
- Screen we're currently writing to.
- When finished writing want to schedule swap to that screen at vsync.
- Get the next screen in the circular list.
- Unless it is being shown, in which case block until free.

Frame display queue.
Fill up queue by rotating left until 'full' - block if full.
0000 -> 0001 -> 0012 -> 0123 -> 1234 -> can't fill.

On vsync empty the queue by popping off the top non-zero item.
1234 -> 0234 -> 0034 -> 0004 -> 0000 -> nothing to display.
Push the previous displayed bank onto the write queue.

Popping the queue happens in IRQ handler with interrupts off.
Probably need to add a lock / disable interrupts when adding to the queue.
Need to store or calculate the length of the queue each time.

=> Actually, this is all overkill, just implement triple buffering, using
an round robin index for displayed, writing and pending banks...
